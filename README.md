Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

Make sure to merge the types.xml into your server types and adjust the item's lifetime, or the items will despawn on server restart and/or if no players are around. The types.xml file is in the mod folder and listed below.

This mod must be installed on both the server & client.
